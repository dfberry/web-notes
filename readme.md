## Frameworks

### Next.js

For [data fetching](https://blog.logrocket.com/ssg-vs-ssr-in-next-js/), Next.js provides three different functions:

* getStaticProps : The page will be pre-rendered at build time
* getServerSideProps:  The page will be pre-rendered at runtime
* getStaticPaths : This function generates a list of pages that will be pre-rendered at build time
