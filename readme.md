# Web notes

## Frameworks

### React

* [TypeScript cheatsheet [docs](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs) & [repo](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)

### Frontend middleware

* [refine](https://refine.dev/docs/examples/data-provider/strapi-graphql/) - Build your React-based CRUD applications, without constraints. An open source, headless web application framework developed with flexibility in mind. Integrating with Cloud services could include: 
  * Azure SDKs
    * Cognitive Search - add search to website - specifically the filtering capability
    * Blob storage - upload/download/get sas token
    * Cosmos DB - NoSQL api
    * Cognitive Services - i18n - Translator text
    * Identity - authentication 
  * GitHub
    * Octokit
    * GraphQL
    * REST   

### Next.js

For [data fetching](https://blog.logrocket.com/ssg-vs-ssr-in-next-js/), Next.js provides three different functions:

* getStaticProps : The page will be pre-rendered at build time
* getServerSideProps:  The page will be pre-rendered at runtime
* getStaticPaths : This function generates a list of pages that will be pre-rendered at build time
